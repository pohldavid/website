## Ingredients

- 1½ cups whole milk
- 1 cup packed light or dark brown sugar 
- 2 tablespoons molasses or dark corn syrup 
- 1¾ cups pumpkin purée (solid pack pumpkin) 
- 1½ teaspoons cinnamon 
- 1 teaspoon ginger 
- ¼ teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg 
- 2½ cups heavy cream 
- 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 
- 1 cup crumbled ginger snaps, vanilla butter cookies, or graham crackers


## INSTRUCTIONS

1. In a medium mixing bowl, use a hand mixer on low speed to combine the milk, brown sugar, and molasses until the sugar is dissolved, about 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in the pumpkin purée, cinnamon, ginger, and nutmeg. Add heavy cream and vanilla.
2. Turn the machine on; pour the mixture into freezer bowl, and let mix until thickened, about 20 to 25 minutes.
3. Add the crumbled cookies during the last 5 minutes of mixing. The ice cream will have a soft, creamy texture. If a firmer consistency is desired, transfer the ice cream to an airtight container and place in freezer for about 2 hours. Remove from freezer about 15 minutes before serving.
