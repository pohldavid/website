Coat the bottom and sides of cake pans with nonstick spray. Line bottom of pans with parchment-paper rounds; spray paper.\nSift cake flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, salt, and baking powder into a medium bowl; set aside. Dissolve espresso powder in hot coffee in a medium bowl and whisk in buttermilk; set aside.\nUsing an electric mixer, beat sugar and butter in a large bowl until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Add eggs one at a time, beating between additions and scraping down sides of bowl as needed. Beat in egg yolk and vanilla. Beat on high speed until doubled in volume and very light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Scrape bottom of bowl well, making sure to incorporate all butter into eggs. Beat for 1 minute longer.\nWith mixer on low speed, beat in flour mixture in 3 additions, alternating with coffee mixture in 2 additions, beginning and ending with dry ingredients. With mixer running, drizzle in chocolate and mix until just blended. Divide batter evenly among cake pans; smooth tops.\nBake cakes until a tester inserted into the center comes out clean, 25–30 minutes. Transfer to wire racks. Let cakes cool in pans for 30 minutes.\nInvert cakes onto racks; peel off parchment and let cool completely. DO AHEAD: Cakes can be made 1 day ahead. Store airtight at room temperature.\nHAZELNUT CRUNCH\nPreheat oven to 350°. Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Spread out nuts on sheet. Toast until fragrant, 6–7 minutes. Coarsely chop nuts; set aside. Line same baking sheet with a fresh sheet of parchment paper; let cool.\nCombine chocolate and butter in a medium heatproof bowl. Set bowl over a large saucepan of simmering water. Heat mixture, stirring often, until melted and smooth. Remove bowl from over saucepan. Stir in hazelnuts and Nutella. Fold in toasted rice cereal. Spread mixture out on prepared sheet; don\u0026rsquo;t worry about spreading it evenly. Freeze until set, about 30 minutes.\nUsing your hands, break crunch into small pieces. DO AHEAD: Hazelnut crunch can be made 4 hours ahead. Cover and chill.\nFROSTING AND ASSEMBLY\nCombine both chocolates and corn syrup in a medium bowl. Bring cream just to a boil in a small saucepan; pour over chocolate mixture. Stir until chocolate is melted and mixture is smooth. Using an electric mixer, beat until cool, 5–6 minutes.\nAdd butter a few pieces at a time; beat until incorporated between additions. Continue to beat mixture until thick and lightened in color, about 5 minutes in a stand mixer and up to 15 minutes with a handheld mixer (if mixture seems very thin, stop occasionally and chill in refrigerator to firm it up before continuing to beat).\nUsing a serrated knife, cut off domed top from each cake to create even layers. Place 1 cake layer on a large plate. Using an offset spatula, spread about 1 cup frosting on top of cake. Sprinkle about 1/2 cup hazelnut crunch over frosting. Place second cake layer on top; press to adhere (this will ensure that the frosting will hold the layers together). Repeat process with another 1 cup frosting and 1/2 cup hazelnut crunch. Top with third cake layer. Spread remaining frosting over top and sides of cake.\nDecorate top of cake with more hazelnut crunch, if desired. Chill cake until frosting is set, 3–4 hours. DO AHEAD: Cake can be assembled 2 days ahead. Cover with a cake dome and keep chilled. Let stand at room temperature for 1 hour before serving.\nInformation #12 to 16 Servings\n14 servings 1 serving contains: Calories (kcal) 820 Fat (g) 55 Saturated Fat (g) 33 Cholesterol (mg) 190 Carbohydrates (g) 84 Dietary Fiber (g) 5 Total Sugars (g) 54 Protein (g) 9 Sodium (mg) 350\nsource: Bon Appetite\n","date":"21 December 2023","permalink":"/food/devils-food-cake-with-hazel-nut-crunch/","section":"Food","summary":"my birthday cake this year","title":"Devils Food Cake with Hazelnut Crunch"},{"content":"Weight # Weight Date Time 197.8 2024-07-01 08:31 195.4 2024-06-30 10:30 194.4 2024-06-29 10:04 193 2024-06-28 07:06 194.6 2024-06-27 08:21 199.8 2024-01-07 06:33 200.0 2024-01-06 08:02 197.2 2024-01-05 05:38 201.2 2024-01-03 07:57 199.2 2024-01-01 06:42 198.2 2023-12-31 06:54 195.0 2023-12-30 08:03 196.0 2023-12-29 04:39 196.8 2023-12-28 08:52 197.6 2023-12-27 06:08 196.4 2023-12-26 07:42 193.6 2023-12-25 05:32 192.4 2023-12-24 05:08 194.0 2023-12-22 04:33 192.4 2023-12-21 03:58 194.2 2023-12-20 10:20 193.4 2023-12-19 04:07 191.0 2023-12-14 06:50 191.4 2023-12-14 04:44 BP # Systolic Diastolic BP Date Time 108 65 59 2024-07-01 08:32 99 52 62 2024-06-30 10:30 114 69 53 2024-06-29 10:04 110 66 58 2024-06-28 07:05 119 72 68 2024-06-27 08:23 125 74 53 2024-01-06 09:09 107 65 78 2024-01-05 07:58 119 73 55 2024-01-03 07:59 122 74 56 2024-01-01 06:42 129 79 53 2023-12-31 06:55 112 72 64 2023-12-30 08:08 110 62 60 2023-12-28 08:57 109 67 57 2023-12-27 07:27 107 70 56 2023-12-26 07:39 102 57 55 2023-12-25 07:57 110 67 59 2023-12-22 09:59 116 69 59 2023-12-21 05:26 106 63 55 2023-12-20 11:08 110 65 52 2023-12-18 07:02 108 74 61 2023-12-18 05:38 123 77 55 2023-12-14 05:32 The Code #On this project I attemp to use the Unix Philosophy and also only the Python Standard Library.
